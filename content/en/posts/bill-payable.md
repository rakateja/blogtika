Accounts Payable (AP) management is a critical function that directly impacts cash flow, vendor relationships, and financial accuracy. In today's competitive business environment, organizations need robust payable solutions to streamline processes, reduce costs, and maintain strong supplier partnerships.

## Understanding Accounts Payable Management

Accounts Payable refers to the money a company owes to its suppliers and vendors for goods and services received but not yet paid for. Effective AP management involves:
